NemeStats
===============

Fun app for tracking games played and won among a fairly stable group of players. Will identify a player's Nemesis based on who beats them the most, and will generate other useful statistics.

Check it out for free at NemeStats.com where it is hosted on Windows Azure.

The site is being developed for fun and to brush ip on the most recent .NET goodness. The code base is being constantly refactored in an effort to demonstrate "Clean Code" as preached by Uncle Bob Martin. I encourage constructive criticism, feature requests, or even pull requests if you'd like to add a feature yourself.
